# Triggers a reload of the Alacritty terminal configuration.
#
# This script works by updating the modification time of the alacritty.toml file.
# If Alacritty is configured to watch its config file for changes, this will
# cause it to reload the configuration, applying any theme changes that have
# been made by other scripts (e.g., `theme-set`).
