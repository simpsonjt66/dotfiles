# theme-set
#
# Sets the system-wide theme by updating a symlink and reloading relevant applications.
#
# This script takes a human-readable theme name as an argument (e.g., "Tokyo Night"),
# converts it to a directory-friendly format (e.g., "tokyo-night"), and then
# updates the `current` theme symlink to point to the new theme directory.
#
# It also reloads Hyprland and sets the terminal theme.

# --- Configuration ---
THEMES_DIR="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/themes"
CURRENT_THEME_DIR="$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/themes/current"

# --- Theme Name Processing ---
# Convert the input theme name to a directory-friendly format.
# 1. `sed -E 's/<[^>]+>//g'`: Removes any pango markup.
# 2. `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'`: Converts to lowercase.
# 3. `tr ' ' '-'`: Replaces spaces with hyphens.
THEME_NAME=$(echo "$1" | sed -E 's/<[^>]+>//g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')
THEME_PATH="$THEMES_DIR/$THEME_NAME"

# --- Theme Validation ---
# Check if the theme directory exists.
if [[ ! -d "$THEME_PATH" ]]; then
  notify-send "Theme '$THEME_NAME' does not exist in $THEMES_DIR"
  exit 1
fi

# --- Theme Application ---

# Update the `current` theme symlink to point to the selected theme.
# The -n flag is important to handle the symlink correctly if it already exists.
ln -nsf "$THEME_PATH" "$CURRENT_THEME_DIR"

# Reload Hyprland to apply any theme-related settings.
hyprctl reload

# Set the terminal theme using a separate script.
theme-set-terminal

# Send a notification to confirm the theme change.
notify-send -a "theme-set" -i dialog-positive "Theme set to $1"
